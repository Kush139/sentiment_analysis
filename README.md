# sentiment_analysis project made for my final prject in my grade 12 computer science class

Uses panda for data manipulation, NLTK for langauge processing, making up the sentiment analysis portion

Employs BeautifulSoup for the web scraping component


Overall, this project takes in a URL for a website, article, etc, and analyzes which segments of the website can be classified as positive, negative, and neautral

Tools like this are useful going forward to detect bias in the media. Although this project is a very simlpe and basic tool at the moment, it is a foundation I plan to improve on in the future as I improve my programming skills.
